o A possible optimization of DFA minimization:
  A pair should be marked if by multiple transitions it can reach a marked pair. So, build a directed graph
  of pairs, where there's an edge from pair Pj to Pi, if there's an input symbol c for which there's a
  transition: Pi --- c ---> Pj.
  Note that the edges are in reverse direction to the transition. This enables us to go BFS-ly go from a 
  marked pair, mark all pairs we find, and remove all of them (including the root).
